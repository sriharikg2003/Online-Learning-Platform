A course project by a group of 4 students from IIT Dharwad with aim of developing a platform for e-learning

Hi Developers,

This is a course project done by my friends and me at IIT Dharwad in the year 2022.

With the goal of delivering smooth flow course management this website serves as an efficient solution. Motivation behind this project is to create instituteâ€™s own classroom portal where Instructors offers courses and students can join his/her course registering it. This system allows students to register multiple courses and complete the course requirements by submitting assignments and taking frequent quizzes. Instructor shall review the class performance and guide students accordingly.
